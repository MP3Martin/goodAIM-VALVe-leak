Hours turned into minutes as I solved puzzles, got past computer-generated barriers, and eventually found the secret download link. In anticipation of getting a glimpse of this otherworldly creation, my heart raced as I booted up the demo. What I went through was illogical and difficult to understand; it was a kaleidoscope of absurdity and wonder.

The leak offered a glimpse into a sinister dimension and was a fleeting synthesis of Valve's brilliance and Unity3D's versatility. I felt honored to have discovered this bizarre and alluring world.
